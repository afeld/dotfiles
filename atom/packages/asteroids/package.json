Well, since Atom is built with web technologies, now you can do the\nsame right in your editor!\n\nAll credit for the Asteroids game code go to Rootof Creations HB <rootof.com>.\nYou can find their original code at https://github.com/erkie/erkie.github.com.\n\nTo play, select `Packages->Asteroids->Play` from the menu bar. Use arrow keys\nto move around and spacebar to fire.\n\nTo return your editor window to normal, select `Window: Reload` from the\ncommand pallette.\n\n![Atom Asteroids](https://f.cloud.github.com/assets/1/2313785/895ea42e-a30d-11e3-96e0-1bcd606a318c.gif)\n",
