linter-coffeelint
=========================

This linter plugin for [Linter](https://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter) provides an interface to [coffeelint](http://www.coffeelint.org/docs/). It will be used with files that have the “CoffeeScript” or “CoffeeScript (literate)” syntax.

## Installation
Linter package must be installed in order to use this plugin. If Linter is not installed, please follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/AtomLinter/Linter).

### Plugin installation
```
$ apm install linter-coffeelint
```

## Settings
You can configure linter-coffeelint by editing ~/.atom/config.cson (choose Open Your Config in Atom menu):
```
'linter-coffeelint':
  'coffeelintExecutablePath': null #coffeelint path. run 'which coffeelint' to find the path
```

**Note**: This plugin finds the nearest coffeelint.json file and uses the `-f` command line argument to use that file, so you may not use the `-f` argument in the linter settings.
