  "readme": "# node-copy-paste\n\nA command line utility that allows read/write (i.e copy/paste) access to the system clipboard.  It does this by wrapping [`pbcopy/pbpaste`](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Darwin/Reference/Manpages/man1/pbcopy.1.html) (for OSX), [`xclip`](http://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/xclip-linux-insert-files-command-output-intoclipboard/) (for linux), and [`clip`](http://www.labnol.org/software/tutorials/copy-dos-command-line-output-clipboard-clip-exe/2506/) (for windows). Currently works with node.js v0.8+.\n\n## The API\n\nWhen `require(\"copy-paste\")` is executed, two global functions are added:\n\n- `copy(text[, callback])`: asynchronously replaces the current contents of the clip board with `text`.  Takes either a string, array, object, or readable stream.  Returns the same value passed in. Optional callback will fire when the copy operation is complete.\n- `paste([callback])`: if no callback is provided, `paste` synchronously returns the current contents of the system clip board.  Otherwise, the contents of the system clip board are passed to the callback as the second parameter.\n\n\t**Note**: The synchronous version of `paste` is not always availabled.  Unfortunately, I'm having a hard time finding a synchronous version of `child_process.exec` that consistently works on all platforms, especially windows.  An error message is shown if the synchronous version of `paste` is used on an unsupported platform.  That said, the asyncchronous version of `paste` is always available.\n\n- `require(\"copy-paste\").noConflict()`:  removes `copy` and `paste` from the global namespace.  Returns an object with `copy` and `paste` as properties.  Can be chained with `silent`.\n- `require(\"copy-paste\").silent()`: suppresses all print statements produced by this module, including ones that report errors.  Returns an object with `copy` and `paste` as properties.  Can be chained with `noConflict`.\n\n## Getting node-copy-paste\n\nThe easiest way to get node-copy-paste is with [npm](http://npmjs.org/):\n\n\tnpm install -g copy-paste\n\nRarely is it a good idea to install modules globally, but `node-copy-paste` is immensely useful while doing work in the REPL or while debugging.  It's nice having it around.\n\nAlternatively you can clone this git repository:\n\n\tgit clone git://github.com/xavi-/node-copy-paste.git\n\n## Future plans\n\nI'm hoping to add various fallbacks for instances when `xclip` or `clip` is not avaiable (see [experimental-fallbacks](https://github.com/xavi-/node-copy-paste/tree/experimental-fallbacks/platform) branch).  Also this library needs to be more thoroughly tested on windows.\n\n## Developed by\n* Xavi Ramirez\n\n## License\nThis project is released under [The MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php).\n",
