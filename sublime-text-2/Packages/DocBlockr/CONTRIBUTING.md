**THEN YOU, SIR OR MADAM, ARE MY FRIEND.**

There's only a couple of things you should know first.

- **The most important thing** is to know there are two main branches. `master` is the "live" stable branch which pushes code into thousands of people's editors. `develop` is the place where development happens.
  - When beginning work on a patch, please start your branches from the latest commit on the `develop` branch. If you've already made some commits, please `git rebase develop` and then continue.
  - When making a pull request, please target it back to the `develop` branch. Pull requests targetting `master` will be rejected.
- Everything else is pretty standard:
  - Trim trailing spaces.
  - Unix line endings.
  - Spaces, not tabs.
  - Run your code through PEP8, or some linting program.

Thank you!
