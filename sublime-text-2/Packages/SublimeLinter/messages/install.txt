SublimeLinter
=============

SublimeLinter is a plugin that supports "lint" programs (known as "linters"). SublimeLinter highlights
lines of code the linter deems to contain (potential) errors. It also
supports highlighting special annotations (for example: TODO) so that they
can be quickly located.

SublimeLinter has built in linters for the following languages:

* Javascript - lint via built in `jshint <http://jshint.org>`_ or the `closure linter (gjslint) <https://developers.google.com/closure/utilities/docs/linter_howto>`_ (if installed)
* Objective-J - lint via built-in `capp_lint <https://github.com/aparajita/capp_lint>`_
* python - native, moderately-complete lint
* ruby - syntax checking via "ruby -wc"
* php - syntax checking via "php -l"
* java - lint via "javac -Xlint"
* perl - syntax+deprecation checking via "perl -c"

Please take the time to read the documentation:

* Sublime Text - Select Preferences->Package Settings->SublimeLinter->README


IMPORTANT

Do NOT edit the default SublimeLinter settings. Your changes will be lost
when SublimeLinter is updated. ALWAYS edit the user SublimeLinter settings
by selecting "Preferences->Package Settings->SublimeLinter->Settings - User".
Note that individual settings you include in your user settings will **completely**
replace the corresponding default setting, so you must provide that setting in its entirety.
