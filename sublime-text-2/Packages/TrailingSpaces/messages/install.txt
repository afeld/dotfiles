    Thank you for installing Trailing Spaces
    ----------------------------------------

    You're now ready to give trailing spaces *a hard time*!

    Waitâ€¦ I guess Package Control just introduced some of them :(
    Why don't you try clicking "Edit / Trailing Spaces / Delete"?



Documentation
=============

Although the usage of this plugin is dead simple, it comes with several options. All
details are available in the documentation, and you can read it by clicking on
"Preferences / Package Settings / Trailing Spaces / Help", or in a prettier form, by
browsing https://github.com/SublimeText/TrailingSpaces.

Key Binding
===========

This plugin does not come with a default key binding for the deletion command. You can
pick your own key binding and define it in "Preferences / Key Bindings - User", or just
stick to using the menu entry under "Edit". Check the help for advice on this.

Upgrades & Issues
=================

Package Control will automatically update all packages every time the editor is started,
so there is nothing for you to worry about. If you however do find the plugin not to work
as it used to, head to the issues tracker (see links below) to report the problem.
