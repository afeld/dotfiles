    Trailing Spaces update [v1.0.0]
    -------------------------------

    Hope you've been happy gaving trailin' a hard time so far.

    I added several features to help you in this honorable questâ€¦

    All details accessible through:

        "Preferences / Package Settings / Trailing Spaces / Help"



New feature: Modified Lines Only
================================

As proposed by a fellow user, it is now possible to target only the lines
modified by You and You Only when deleting trailing spaces.

This feature will certainly please coders who edit third-party code filled
with trailing spaces but do not want to commit giant diffs, just their little
fix, while keeping it clean.

New feature: Trim On Save
=========================

This option allows for automatic deletion upon saving. No more lost trailing
spaces! A perfect combo to the "Modified Lines Only" setting I guess.

New feature: Save After Trim
============================

A different kind of automation: many users just want those trailings out and
forget 'bout them. It is now made even easier with this auto-saving hook. Fire
the deletion command, and your document is clean on the hard drive!

At the current time, "Trim On Save" and "Save After Trim" cannot be both
enabled (the former wins), but this is on the roadmap.

New Menu
========

Some of the settings seemed a bit more important than the others. Along the
deletion command, the toggling command/state and the "Modified Lines Only"
setting have been elected first-class citizens of the new "Edit / Trailing
Spaces" menu. Any change made by click here is live, persistent and reflected
in the JSON settings file. Settings are global to all open documents.

Improvements & Misc.
====================

- Support for custom matching patterns (danger!).
- Performance improvements (reduced overhead, with some room for further
  improvements).
- Better documentation (both code & user doc).
- Lazy "On-demand" matching improved.
